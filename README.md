OutWalkin Readme

This code should create a simple navigation program, which lets the user walk around (hence the name) a world defined in the supplied text file. Parameters for that world are in the World.java file. OutWalkin is the main file, and requires a correctly-formatted txt file for the world information.

Room file specs are found in the World.java file at the moment.

Initial specs finished. Code compiles and runs as desired. Now, it's time for feature bloat! Separate room names! Exit descriptions! Combat! Tighten the graphics on level 3! Unskippable cutscenes!
