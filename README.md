OutWalkin Readme

This code should create a simple navigation program, which lets the user walk around (hence the name) a world defined in the supplied text file. Parameters for that world are in the World.java file. OutWalkin is the main file, and requires a correctly-formatted txt file for the world information.

Presently, the program hangs on world generation. It's sort of been a spaghetti code project, as Eclipse was set to some obscure compatibility version, so things like enums and certain string methods were unacceptable. So, this code's been run around a bit. I intend to track down the problem and tighten things up later, but it's 9:30 and I've got a long walk home ahead of me, so development stops for today.

TODO:
* figure out why the world isn't loading
* copy world parameters in here
* grumble about the lack of streetlights between here and my house
